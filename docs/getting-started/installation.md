</figure>


### Removing previous versions

If you have a version of this asset prior to 3.0.0 installed, you will need to completely remove it from your project before importing 3.0.0, to avoid conflicts.

### Requirements
Both skybox techniques used in this asset require Unity's Shader Graph package. It comes pre-installed in projects using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).

The VFX Graph Skybox technique is built with Unity's Visual Effect Graph package. 

When importing the asset from the Package Manager, you will get a pop-up window asking you to install both:
