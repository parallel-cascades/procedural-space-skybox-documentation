# Procedural Gas Giants

Similar to Procedural Stars, Gas Giants are built with domain warped FBM noise, but the pattern is kept constant around the Y axis, to produce distinct vertical layers.

You can control the variation along each axis using the X and Z Scaling and Y Gradient Scale and Strength Properties. Observe the difference between the Saturn and Jupiter samples in the Sample Scene.
